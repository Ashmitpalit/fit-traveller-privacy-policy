                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> We only access your device's GPS location when you explicitly choose
                        to use the distance filter feature. Location access is <strong>optional</strong> and <strong>not
                            required</strong> to use the App.</p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>When We Access Your Location:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Only When You Use Distance Filter:</strong> We access your device's GPS location
                        exclusively when you enable the distance filter feature in the companion search screen</li>
                    <li><strong>On-Demand Access:</strong> Location permission is requested only at the moment you
                        activate the distance filter, not when you first open the App</li>
                    <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You have full control - you can use the App without ever granting
                        location permission</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What Location Data We Collect:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your Current GPS Location:</strong> When you enable distance filtering, we temporarily
                        access your current latitude and longitude coordinates</li>
                    <li><strong>Event/Activity Locations:</strong> When you create a group or companion request, you
                        provide the location (city and coordinates) where the activity will take place - this is stored
                        in our database</li>
                    <li><strong>Profile Location:</strong> You may optionally provide your city/location in your profile
                        (this is text-based, not GPS coordinates)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How We Use Location Data:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distance Calculations:</strong> We use your current GPS location to calculate the
                        distance between you and nearby companions/activities</li>
                    <li><strong>Filtering Results:</strong> We filter companion search results to show only those within
                        your specified maximum distance (in kilometers)</li>
                    <li><strong>Finding Nearby Activities:</strong> We help you discover sports, food, and travel
                        companions who are geographically close to you</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Location Data Storage:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your GPS Location:</strong> We do <strong>NOT</strong> store your current GPS location
                        permanently. It is used only temporarily for distance calculations and is immediately discarded
                        after use</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Locations:</strong> The locations where activities/events will take place
                        (provided by users when creating groups) are stored in Firebase. These are public event
                        locations, not personal user locations</li>
                    <li><strong>No Continuous Tracking:</strong> We do not track your location continuously or in the
                        background. Location is accessed only when you actively use the distance filter</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Location Permissions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Permission Type:</strong> We request "When In Use" location permission (not "Always"
                        permission)</li>
                    <li><strong>Permission Control:</strong> You can grant or deny location permission at any time
                        through your device settings</li>
                    <li><strong>No Permission Required:</strong> The App functions fully without location permission -
                        you can search by city, activity type, and other filters without using GPS location</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Create and manage your user account, authenticate your
                        identity, and provide access to App features</li>
                    <li><strong>Matching & Discovery:</strong> Enable you to discover other users with shared interests

                    <li><strong>Location-Based Features:</strong> When you enable distance filtering, we use your GPS
                        location to calculate distances and show nearby companions/activities. Your current location is
                        used temporarily and not stored</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> Analyze usage patterns to improve App functionality and
                        user experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal
                        processes</li>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>4. Location Services & Privacy</h2>
                <p>This section provides detailed information about how we handle location data, which is a sensitive
                    type of personal information.</p>

                <h3>a. When Location is Accessed</h3>
                <p>We access your device's GPS location <strong>only</strong> in the following specific scenario:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distance Filter Feature:</strong> When you are browsing companions (sports, food, or
                        travel) and you choose to enable the distance filter by setting a maximum distance (e.g., "Show
                        companions within 5 km")</li>
                    <li><strong>One-Time Access:</strong> Each time you use the distance filter, we request your current
                        location once to perform the distance calculation</li>
                    <li><strong>Not on App Launch:</strong> We do not access your location when you first open the App
                        or when you browse companions without using the distance filter</li>
                    <li><strong>Not in Background:</strong> We never access your location when the App is running in the
                        background or when you're not actively using the distance filter</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>b. How Location is Accessed</h3>
                <p>When you enable the distance filter:</p>
                <ol style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    <li>You set a maximum distance (e.g., 5 km, 10 km, 20 km) in the companion search screen</li>
                    <li>The App requests "When In Use" location permission (if not already granted)</li>
                    <li>If you grant permission, we use the Geolocator service to get your current GPS coordinates
                        (latitude and longitude) with high accuracy</li>
                    <li>We calculate the distance between your location and each companion/activity location</li>
                    <li>We filter the results to show only companions within your specified distance</li>
                    <li>Your current GPS location is immediately discarded after the calculation - it is not stored</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>c. What Happens If You Deny Location Permission</h3>
                <p>If you deny location permission or if location services are disabled:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The App continues to function normally</li>
                    <li>You can still search for companions using other filters (city, activity type, gender, age, date)
                    </li>
                    <li>The distance filter will simply show all results without distance-based filtering</li>
                    <li>You can still create groups, join activities, and use all other App features</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>d. Location Data We Store</h3>
                <p><strong>We DO Store:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Event/Activity Locations:</strong> When users create a group or companion request, they
                        provide the location (city name and GPS coordinates) where the activity will take place. These
                        are public event locations stored in Firebase and visible to all users searching for companions
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Profile City:</strong> If you choose to add your city/location to your profile, this
                        text-based information is stored (this is optional and not GPS-based)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>We DO NOT Store:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your Current GPS Location:</strong> Your real-time GPS coordinates are never stored in
                        our database</li>
                    <li><strong>Location History:</strong> We do not track or store your location history or movement
                        patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Background Location:</strong> We never access or store your location when the App is not
                        actively being used</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>e. Third-Party Location Services</h3>
                <p>We use the following services for location functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Geolocator Package:</strong> We use the Geolocator plugin (Flutter) to access your
                        device's GPS location. This service only accesses location when explicitly requested by our App
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>No Location Sharing:</strong> We do not share your GPS location data with any
                        third-party advertising or analytics services</li>
